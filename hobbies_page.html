    <h3>Hobbies</h3>

    <p class="overview">For my hobbies, I won't go too in depth about them, as that's what our assignment is about. But I have quite a lot of hobbies, as I hate being bored and lazy (crazy I know). One of my most time consuming and favourite hobbies is gaming, I enjoy older games, on a variety of consoles, such as the Playstation 2, Gamecube, Gameboy, DS, and so on. I'm trying to get myself back into gaming, as I took a pause for a bit since I've started school. Another hobby I really enjoy is sewing, growing up my grandmother and mother both taught me to sew, and the older I got, I began to endulge myself in it more and I've found it quite fun to make my own clothes. As well I enjoy cooking, as a child I used to watch my family cook and understand how to do things. So when I started 3rd grade I started staying home by myself and I had to learn to cook for myself. Since then I try and cook atleast 4 times a week to give myself more experience, I also find it very theraputic. I also enjoy music, I'm very into cultural music but I also enjoy a bit of indie music here and there. Another hobby is reading, I'm quite a book nerd if I say so myself, as I love books, my favourite genre has to be horror. More specifically horror manga, one of my favourite authors is a Japanese author named Junji Ito, his books keep me wanting more, and his art style is so captivating to me. I don't wanna go too in depth on all my hobbies, but I also enjoy gardening,watching flim and television, coding (somewhat) and cleaning to name a few. </p>

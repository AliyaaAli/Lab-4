    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p class="overview" >Welcome to my all about me website, keep reading to get to learn more about me, Aliya. My name is Aliya Ali, I was born on September 9th, 2006 and I grew up in Brampton, Ontario. Both of my parents are immigrants that come from Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. 
    Growing up I honestly didn't expect to end up in the program I'm in right now, as I originally wanted to become a criminal lawyer, but later found a huge interest in computer programming, so much so that I wanted to pursue it. It also persuaded me a lot that my brother-in-law is in the same field of IT as well. 
    Family wise, I live with my mom, my two older sisters, my brother, my brother-in-law, and my niece. As you explore my webpage you'll see some of my skills, and hobbies (which you'll also hear more about on my Assignment 1). </p>

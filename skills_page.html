    <h3>Skills</h3>

    <p class="overview" >Honestly, I haven't practiced some of these skills in a while, so I don't know how good I'd be at them now, but I used to be very good. One of my most useful skills is my ability to type without looking at my keyboard, although I'm not a pro at this skill yet, I'll gdet there.. in time. 
        This skill is useful because it allows me to look at a lecture, and type without looking down. Another skill I have (but I'm not sure if I'm good at anymore) is playing a few cultural instruments, they are reffered to as a tabla and harmonium. It's honestly been quite a few years since I played them so I might be a little rusty, but I spent a portion of my life playing these. 
        Chess master is another, not to brag but I'm quite good at chess if I do say so myself. I used to be on a chess team in my middle school, but I didn't end up doing it in highschool, as I did online school for half of my highschool years. I'm also very good at things like sewing, and cooking/baking (as I've been told). 
        One really weird thing I'm surprisingly good at is chugging water, it's a very strange skill but I'm able to finish a whole bottle in less than 11 seconds usually. I'm also very good at photography, as I picked up a few photography skills in grade 11 when I was apart of my schools yearbook. Overall, 
        I hope to develop more skills in the future and move forward and learn more.</p>
